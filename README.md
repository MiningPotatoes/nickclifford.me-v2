The next iteration of my personal website.

## Setup
Run `bundle install` to install all of the dependencies.

## Running
Just run `rackup` to start the server. By default, it runs on port 3692, but this can be changed with the `-p` flag.

## TODO
- [Scroll snapping](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-css-scroll-snap-points/)
- Languages/experience?
  - At least something about experience with Ruby, Node, PHP, etc.
- More FA icon links?
